# Bing Bing Wahoo
Bringing the physics of Super Mario 64 to Minecraft, one wahoo at a time.<br>
Made for ModFest 1.17.
# Features
Bing Bing Wahoo has a variety of features designed to fill your wahooing needs. <br>
- Double / Triple Jump
    - After jumping, jump again shortly after you land to jump higher!
    - The 3rd jump in a row (Triple Jump) will make you do a flip!
    - Higher jumps will not activate when holding the jump button, it 
      must be tapped each time.
    
- Long Jump
    - Activated by quickly holding crouch and jumping while moving. 
    - Backwards long jump included!
    
- Dive
    - Triggered by clicking the attack button while sprinting. Works midair and on 
      the ground, however ground activation may be annoying, so it is configurable 
      through Mod Menu.
    
- Bonking
    - Hitting a wall too hard will knock you over for a bit!
    - Disabled in creative mode.
    
- Wall Jump
    - Once you jump into a wall, you have a short time to jump again, and 
      you will be sent in the opposite direction.
    - Does not activate for regular jumps by default, too annoying. However, 
      can be enabled through Mod Menu.
    
- Ground Pound
    - Crouching midair will make you do a flip and send you flying downwards!
    - Soft blocks will crumble beneath you as you plummet!
    - Gain enough velocity by falling for long enough, and the impact will 
      cause an explosion!
    - Fall damage from a Ground Pound will never be lethal.
    
- Ledge Grab
    - If you jump up to the edge of a flat block, you'll grab onto it!
    - Disables looking left and right.
    - Pressing forwards or jump will boost you up!
    - Pressing other movement keys or sneak will drop you down.
    
- Backflip
    - If you jump while sneaking and standing still, you will do a backflip 
      and be sent backwards!
    - Could be annoying, so it can be disabled through Mod Menu.

# Photosensitivity warning
The flips caused by some moves may be too much for some people. If 
this is the case for you, you can lower `Degrees per frame` in the 
mod's config menu, accessed through Mod Menu. Setting it to 0 will 
disable flips completely. `6`, the default, works best on 60 FPS. `2`
works well for 250 FPS.
